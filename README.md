# puzzleQuest
The Puzzle Quest game, created by me using JavaFX, features a picture puzzle. The game includes music control functionality, allowing players to adjust the game's sound according to their preferences. Additionally, the game offers three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard, providing players with a range of challenges to choose from.
